				<h1>WHY THE OTI?</h1>
				
				<p class = "leftParagraph">
					Other Big Five tests tell you at most whether you are high or low in each trait, amounting to a total of 5 unique descriptors per person.  The OTI offers descriptors for whether you are low, medium, or high for each trait; but more importantly, it allows for different levels of each trait to interact with one another, making it possible to apply exponentially more unique descriptors to each person.
				</p><p class = "leftParagraph">Additionally, non-generalized personality tests may be more focused for any one area (e.g. work preferences, “love languages”, etc), but are disadvantaged at capturing the larger picture of who a person is as a whole.
				</p><p class = "leftParagraph">
					What does this model do differently than the <span class = "emphasize">Myers-Briggs Type Indicator</span>?  Well, the MBTI is unpopular by psychologists when it comes to professional use for multiple reasons, and this test seeks to excel where the MBTI falls short.
				</p><p class = "leftParagraph">
					For one, the MBTI's traits are based off <span class = "emphasize">Jung's Theory of Cognitive Functions</span>.  While Jung was very influential in psychology, his theory is wildly outdated for measuring personality compared to the Big Five Model.  Jung's theory was based around <span class = "subEmphasize">eight cognitive functions</span> (or personality traits), and the qualities unique to these functions are often found to overlap with one another.  This method was simplified into the MBTI, and although the MBTI has been brushed up on over the years due to its widespread public interest, its foundations are ultimately unstable.  The OTI, on the other hand, was founded to measure the most scientifically-backed general traits personality psychology has to offer.
				</p><p class = "leftParagraph">
					Moreover, no qualities measured by the MBTI are good or bad.  Assertiveness and turbulence are often measured in conjunction with the MBTI account for this, but they do not affect the person's personality type.  Hence, the MTBI's approach of "everybody wins" is erroneous and doesn't paint the full picture; in job applications, some people are better-suited for a position than others.  The OCEAN traits, on the other hand, have stronger positive and negative implications; for instance, openness is a great way to gauge a person's creativity and capacity for abstract thinking, conscientiousness is a fantastic predictor of a person's success, and neuroticism is a strong negative correlate with emotional stability and happiness.
				</p><p class = "leftParagraph">
					The MBTI also organizes your traits in a certain order based on your assigned type.  While this may simplify things, it circumvents creating a personality type for every possible combination of cognitive functions.  Thus, a person's Jungian traits will rarely directly align with any MBTI type, and this generalization may lead to <span class = "subEmphasize">vastly inaccurate personality readings</span>.  The OTI addresses this by creating a personality type for every possible combination of Big Five Model's traits.

				</p><p class = "leftParagraph">
					And most importantly, the MBTI polarizes the results of the test.  If you are, for instance, ambiverted- neither introverted nor extraverted- the MBTI will label you as completely extraverted or completely introverted.  This creates drastic problems for people with less pronounced traits in any area, as for instance, an INFJ and an INFP's cognitive functions are the <span class = "subEmphasize">complete opposite</span>, despite the seemingy ineffectual difference of one letter.  And someone with, say, 51% Juding will have very low test-retest reliability.  In other words, the MBTI assigns people to certain personalities based on the idea that they completely exhibit every cognitive function of their personality, so people who retake the test will frequently end up with results dichotomous to the last time they took it.
				</p><p class = "leftParagraph">
					The OTI addresses this problem by creating a <span class = "emphasize">trinary form of measurement</span> which acknowledges high and low, as well as neutral, expressions of each trait.  For your level of extraversion, we measure you to be introverted, ambiverted, OR extraverted, and we measure an equivalent for every trait.
				</p><p class = "leftParagraph">
					Note that we are not against the MBTI.  Despite its faults, over the years it has been well fleshed-out by both its community and by websites that administer it.  It is also an easy topic to discuss with other people due to its directness and simplicity.  Hence, the OTI should not be viewed as a replacement for the MBTI; rather, it should be viewed as an alternative: as less of a casual test, and as more of a <span class = "subEmphasize">nuanced, accurate measurement</span> of personality.  It will certainly be more difficult to discuss the OTI than to discuss the MBTI, but that is the cost of its maximal validity and reliability.
