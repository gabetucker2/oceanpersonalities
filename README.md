# oceanpersonalities
This is a newly-established github page for backing up oceanpersonalities.

Long-Term TODO:
* Make Wheel prototype
* Update site/database to have NEO PI-R compatibility.
* Make two test versions: the quick and the accurate.
* Never exclude people from seeing their data; just warn them.

[Visit it locally here](http://localhost/OceanPersonalities) after you get it set up under your local XAMPP/htdocs directory.
