Short-Term TODO:
* As it gets further up, offset y positively.
* As it gets further down, offset y negatively.

Long-Term TODO:
* Update site/database to have NEO PI-R compatibility.
* Make two test versions: the quick and the accurate.
* Never exclude people from seeing their data; just warn them.
* Finish Circle
* Make Wheel prototype
