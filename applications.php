				<h1>APPLICATIONS</h1>

				<p class = "leftParagraph">
					The applications for the OTI are plentiful.  There are more than we can name, but we will do our best in this section to quickly delineate where the OTI should, and (more importantly) should not, generally, be used.
				</p>


				<h2>INTROSPECTION</h2>
				<p class = "leftParagraph">
					Introspection is great, and this is the main appeal of personality type-indicators.
				</p>

				<h2>SOCIAL PURPOSES</h2>
				<p class = "leftParagraph">
					Can be a great conversation-starter or fun activity to complete during a social event.
				</p>

				<h2>CONNECTING WITH OTHERS</h2>
				<p class = "leftParagraph">
					Great way to learn about what you and others have in common.
				</p>

				<h2 class = "warning">JOB PLACEMENTS</h2>
				<p class = "leftParagraph">
					We cannot recommend that this test be used for job placements.  At most, we hope that this can be a conversation-starter for the preferences of an individual and as a guide for what people who answer similarly generally tend to succeed in.  But reducing a person's capacity to perform a complex task to non-deterministic correlations between things that may influence their ability to perform this task is likely to deprive many competent individuals of the opportunity to succeed.
				</p>

				<h2 class = "warning">PREJUDICE</h2>
				<p class = "leftParagraph">
					Type-indicators, whether the MBTI, Enneagram Test, or astrology (which has no scientific merit), have communities that often tie themselves closely to the philosophies that underly these tests.  Understanding people in terms of the MBTI, for example, can be a great way to quickly understand many things about a person.  However, as is the nature with any social categories that apply to people, they can, and often do, result in prejudice.
					<br/><br/>
					For example, 40% of hiring managers in China have frequent discussions along the lines of how zodiac signs affect their hiring decisions.  And in the MBTI community, there seems to be strong malevolent prejudice toward sensors (as opposed to intuitives), and strong benevolent prejudice toward types which correlate strongly and positively with IQ (especially introverted intuitive types).  This is completely backwards and untoward, and we did not at all create the test so that people could use it for these purposes.  Moreover, the five traits this test measures couldn't possibly account for the majority of things there are to understand about a person's personality, so holding pejorative views on the basis of this test's merit is completely invalid, and it paints an incomplete picture of any given person.
					<br/><br/>
					We only ask that people take this precondition into consideration before making any judgements.  The objective of our test is to help people better understand themselves and othersâ€“ not to create another means through which arbitrary labels can be ascribed to individuals so as to deprive them of perceived individuality.
