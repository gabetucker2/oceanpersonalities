				<h1>COGNITIVE FUCNTIONS</h1>
				
				<p class = "centerParagraph">
					<span class = "emphasize">Jung's Theory of Cognitive Functions</span> measures eight cognitive functions.  The MBTI assumes that each person has only four and that they're expressed in a different order depending on each personality type.  The order determines how pronounced each trait is, respectively.  The personality acronyms (e.g. ENTP, ISFJ) in the MBTI express a few possible orders of these functions in a simplified manner.
				</p>
				
				<div class = "line"></div>
				
				<ul>
					<li class = "clickable noClickColor">Introverted Intuition - NI</li>
					<li class = "clickable noClickColor">extraverted Intuition - NE</li>
					<li class = "clickable noClickColor">Introverted Sensing - SI</li>
					<li class = "clickable noClickColor">extraverted Sensing - SE</li>
					<li class = "clickable noClickColor">Introverted Feeling - FI</li>
					<li class = "clickable noClickColor">extraverted Feeling - FE</li>
					<li class = "clickable noClickColor">Introverted Thinking - TI</li>
					<li class = "clickable noClickColor">extraverted Thinking - TE</li>
				</ul>
				
				<div class = "line"></div>
				
				<p class = "centerParagraph">
					How, then, can the MBTI's 16 personalities account for the 1,680 possible orderings of these traits?  In short, they do not.  The MBTI presupposes that there are not 1,680, but 16 orders in which these traits can be expressed for the sake of simplification.  In theory, there is a 0.95% chance that you actually have an identical ordering for your cognitive functions as your MBTI assumes.
					
					<br/><br/>An ESFJ, for instance, would have the following traits:
				</p>
				
				<div class = "line"></div>
				
				<ul>
					<li class = "clickable noClickColor">Primary FE</li>
					<li class = "clickable noClickColor">Auxiliary SI</li>
					<li class = "clickable noClickColor">Tertiary NE</li>
					<li class = "clickable noClickColor">Inferior TI</li>
				</ul>
				
				<div class = "line"></div>
				
				<p class = "centerParagraph">
					However, most who were assigned the ESFJ personality type by the MBTI will not exhibit all of these traits, much less in this order.  This, in addition to how it relies on an archaic personality theory, is why the validity of the MBTI is problematic and why its claims are much more generalized and presumptive.
