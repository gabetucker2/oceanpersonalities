				<h1>TERMINOLOGY</h1>
				
				<p class = "leftParagraph">
					Individual OTI types are referred to in three general ways.
				</p><p class = "leftParagraph">The first and most simple way of referring to a type is by its colloquial name (e.g. "Esoterics", "Historians", etc).  Given the nature of the test, however, there are far too many types for the name alone to be clear to most people, so it is only recommended to use this method when the type has already been specified by using one of the two subsequent methods.
				</p><p class = "leftParagraph">The second way to refer to types is by using the following format: OxCxExAxNx.  x in this acronym represents the corresponding valency–1 through 3–with each of the traits.  It may be read aloud, for example, like the following: “Openness-3, conscientiousness-1, extraversion-2, agreeableness-2, neuroticism-1”.  Alternatively, it may read as “O-3, C-1, E-2, A-2, N-1”.  But written, this example would look like: O3C1E2A2N1.
				</p><p class = "leftParagraph">And finally, the third way to refer to an OTI type.  The previous method is a bit cluttered, so when it has been established that the OTI is being referred to or when it is being discussed between people familiar with this typology, it is recommended to use the following format: xxxxx.  x in this acronym represents the same valencies; the only difference is that the traits are implied rather than explicitly expressed.  To be read aloud, for example, it is recommended not to read it as one number, but instead to say, “3, 1, 2, 2, 1”.  This would be written as 31221.
				</p><p class = "leftParagraph">To refer to many different types at once, either of the previous acronym-based methods may be used while replacing ambiguous valencies with 0.  For example, if you wanted to refer to all types that are both high in conscientiousness and low in neuroticism, you would say, 03001, or O0C3E0A0N1.  In so doing, you filter your reference from an individual type to however many types fit your specified acronym.
				</p><p class = "leftParagraph">We hope these methods make it easier to understand and discuss the 243 types in our typology.  If you have any suggestions or feel that our explanation was unclear, please let us know via the email provided in our footer.
